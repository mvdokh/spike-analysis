Quality Control

1. Show full raster plot of all units (with pico intervals highlighted)
    This can be done 2 ways:
        a. Create one super wide raster plot (needed to resolve intervals) 
        b. specify a time range to show for all units or just some units

2. Total spikes / Firing rate heatmap
        a. Show plot of all channels ordered by total number of spikes for the entire video
        b. Show plot of all channels ordered by firing rate for the entire video
                Firing rate = Total spikes / Total time
        c. Show plot of all UNITS ordered by # spikes
        d. Show plot of all UNITS ordered by firing rate
        e. Show electrode schematic based on .cfg with heatmap of firing / electrode

2. Fourier Power Spectra
